# Airline-Workforce-Scheduling-using-Multi-Agent-Systems

This repository is intended to show the solution for the workforce scheduling problem in the context of an airline in Colombia.
The GAIA methodology was used for the design and analysis of the multi-agent systems, while JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment Framework) was used for the development of agents and for the implementation of the solution to the problem of personnel scheduling.

This repository contains:

- Source code for the workforce scheduling of the airline using the JADE framework, FIPA-ACL communication. To solve the problem at hand, a genetic algorithm was implemented.
