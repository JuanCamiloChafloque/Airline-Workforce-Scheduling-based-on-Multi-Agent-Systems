# Airline-Workforce-Scheduling-using-Multi-Agent-Systems

This repository is intended to show the solution to the workforce scheduling problem at the check-in counters of an airline company in the El Dorado Airport, Colombia.
The GAIA methodology was used for the design and analysis of the multi-agent systems, while JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment Framework) was used for the development of agents and for the implementation of the solution to the problem of personnel scheduling.

This repository contains:

- Information provided by the airline that will be used as entry parameters. This information contains all the restrictions that the solution must meet, data from the airline employees, such as the skills to carry out tasks.

- Diagrams and documentation describing in more detail the case study, its justification, the objectives proposed by the work team and finally the development of the proposed methodology, showing the step by step of the analysis and design phase governed by the agent-oriented methodology GAIA.

- Source code for the workforce scheduling of the airline using the JADE framework and FIPA-ACL communication. To solve the problem at hand, a genetic algorithm was implemented.
